    <!-- Preventing default behavior.

    Sometimes, you'll come across a situation where you want to prevent an event from doing what it does by default. The most common example is that of a web form, for example, a custom registration form. When you fill in the details and click the submit button, the natural behavior is for the data to be submitted to a specified page on the server for processing, and the browser to be redirected to a "success message" page of some kind (or the same page, if another is not specified).

    The trouble comes when the user has not submitted the data correctly — as a developer, you want to prevent the submission to the server and give an error message saying what's wrong and what needs to be done to put things right. Some browsers support automatic form data validation features, but since many don't, you are advised to not rely on those and implement your own validation checks. Let's look at a simple example. -->
    <form>
    <div>
        <label for="fname">First name: </label>
        <input id="fname" type="text" />
    </div>
    <div>
        <label for="lname">Last name: </label>
        <input id="lname" type="text" />
    </div>
    <div>
        <input id="submit" type="submit" />
    </div>
    </form>
    <p></p> 

    <script>
        // Now some JavaScript — here we implement a very simple check inside a handler for the submit event (the submit event is fired on a form when it is submitted) that tests whether the text fields are empty. If they are, we call the preventDefault() function on the event object — which stops the form submission — and then display an error message in the paragraph below our form to tell the user what's wrong:
        const form = document.querySelector("form");
        const fname = document.getElementById("fname");
        const lname = document.getElementById("lname");
        const para = document.querySelector("p");

        form.addEventListener("submit", (e) => {
        if (fname.value === "" || lname.value === "") {
            e.preventDefault();
            para.textContent = "You need to fill in both names!";
        }
        });
        // Obviously, this is pretty weak form validation — it wouldn't stop the user from validating the form with spaces or numbers entered into the fields, for example.
    </script>
