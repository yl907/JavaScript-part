<!-- Events are things that happen in the system you are programming — the system produces (or "fires") a signal of some kind when an event occurs, and provides a mechanism by which an action can be automatically taken (that is, some code running) when the event occurs. Events are fired inside the browser window, and tend to be attached to a specific item that resides in it. This might be a single element, a set of elements, the HTML document loaded in the current tab, or the entire browser window. There are many different types of events that can occur. -->
<!-- To react to an event, you attach an event handler to it. This is a block of code (usually a JavaScript function that you as a programmer create) that runs when the event fires. When such a block of code is defined to run in response to an event, we say we are registering an event handler. Note: Event handlers are sometimes called event listeners — they are pretty much interchangeable for our purposes, although strictly speaking, they work together. The listener listens out for the event happening, and the handler is the code that is run in response to it happening. -->


<!-- Note: Web events are not part of the core JavaScript language — they are defined as part of the APIs built into the browser. -->


<!-- An example: handling a click event
In the following example, we have a single <button> in the page: -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-us">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
    <title>event learning section</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <button>Change color</button>

    <script>
        const btn = document.querySelector("button");

        function random(number) {
            return Math.floor(Math.random() * (number + 1));
        }

        btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
            const rndCol = `rgb(${random(255)}, ${random(255)}, ${random(255)})`;
            document.body.style.backgroundColor = rndCol;
        });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
