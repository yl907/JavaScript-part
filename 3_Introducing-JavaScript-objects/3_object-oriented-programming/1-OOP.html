        // 1.Classes and instances
        // When we model a problem in terms of objects in OOP, we create abstract definitions representing the types of objects we want to have in our system. For example, if we were modeling a school, we might want to have objects representing professors. Every professor has some properties in common: they all have a name and a subject that they teach. Additionally, every professor can do certain things: they can all grade a paper and they can introduce themselves to their students at the start of the year, for example.

        // So Professor could be a class in our system. The definition of the class lists the data and methods that every professor has.

        // In pseudocode, a Professor class could be written like this:
        // "class Professor
        //     properties
        //         name
        //         teaches
        //     methods
        //         grade(paper)
        //         introduceSelf()"

        // This defines a Professor class with:
        // 1.two data properties: name and teaches
        // 2.two methods: grade() to grade a paper and introduceSelf() to introduce themselves.

        // On its own, a class doesn't do anything: it's a kind of template for creating "concrete objects" of that type. Each concrete professor we create is called an "instance" of the Professor class. The process of creating an instance is performed by a special function called a constructor. We pass values to the constructor for any internal state that we want to initialize in the new instance.
