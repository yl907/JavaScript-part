        // 1.Classes and constructors
        // You can declare a class using the class keyword. Here's a class declaration for our Person from the previous article:
        class Person {
            name;

            constructor(name) {
                this.name = name;
            }

            introduceSelf() {
                console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}`);
            }
        }
        // This declares a class called Person, with:
            // 1.a name property.
            // 2.a constructor that takes a name parameter that is used to initialize the new object's name property
            // 3.an introduceSelf() method that can refer to the object's properties using this.

        // DECLARATION IS OPTIONAL!! CONSTRUCTOR CAN CREATE PROPERTIES.
        // The "name;" declaration is optional: you could omit it, and the line "this.name = name;" in the constructor will create the name property before initializing it. However, listing properties explicitly in the class declaration might make it easier for people reading your code to see which properties are part of this class.

        // INITIALIZATION
        // You could also initialize the property to a default value when you declare it, with a line like name = '';.

        // The constructor is defined using the constructor keyword. Just like a constructor outside a class definition, it will:

        // create a new object
        // bind this to the new object, so you can refer to this in your constructor code
        // run the code in the constructor
        // return the new object.
        // Given the class declaration code above, you can create and use a new Person instance like this:
        const giles = new Person("Giles");

        giles.introduceSelf(); // Hi! I'm Giles
        // Note that we call the constructor using the name of the class, Person in this example.


        // 2.Omitting constructors
        // If you don't need to do any special initialization, you can omit the constructor, and a default constructor will be generated for you:
        class Animal {
            sleep() {
                console.log("zzzzzzz");
            }
        }

        const spot = new Animal();

        spot.sleep(); // 'zzzzzzz'


        // 3.Inheritance
        // Given our Person class above(it's in the "1.Classes and constructors" section), let's define the Professor subclass.
        class Professor extends Person {
            // property of this class.(what class the professor teaches?)
            teaches;
            
            // constructor of this class.
            constructor(name, teaches) {
                super(name);
                this.teaches = teaches;    
            }

            // the method the professor has.
            introduceSelf() {
                console.log(
                `My name is ${this.name}, and I will be your ${this.teaches} professor. `,
                );
            }
            // another method
            grade(paper) {
                const grade = Math.floor(Math.random() * (5 - 1) + 1);
                console.log(grade);
            }
        }
        // 3.1.inherit from the previous class.
        // We use the extends keyword to say that this class inherits from another class.
        // 3.2.create something new for the subclass.
        // The Professor class adds a new property teaches, so we declare that.
        // 3.3.how all these actually happens in the place.
        // Since we want to set teaches when a new Professor is created, we define a constructor, which takes the name and teaches as arguments. The first thing this constructor does is call the superclass constructor using super(), passing up the name parameter. The superclass constructor takes care of setting name. After that, the Professor constructor sets the teaches property.
        // Note: If a subclass has any of its own initialization to do, it must first call the superclass contructor using super(), passing up any parameters that the superclass constructor is expecting.

        // (Compare to the Person class) We've also overridden the introduceSelf() method from the superclass, and added a new method grade(), to grade a paper(our professor isn't very good, and just assigns random grades to papers).

        // With this declaration we can now create and use professors:
        const walsh = new Professor()
        walsh.introduceSelf(); // 'My name is Walsh, and I will be your Psychology professor'
        walsh.grade('my paper'); // some random grade

        // 4.Encapsulation
        // Finally, let's see how to implement encapsulation in JavaScript. In the last article we discussed how we would like to make the year property of Student private, so we could change the rules about archery classes without breaking any code that uses the Student class.

        // Here's a declaration of the Student class that does just that:
        class Student extends Person {
            // so in JavaScript, # means it's private.
            #year;

            // constructor
            constructor(name, year) {
                // invoke the Person constructor
                super(name);
                this.#year = year;
            }

            // method (this is overridden)
            introduceSelf() {
                console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}, and I'm in year ${this.#year}.`);
            }

            // method (this is a new one)
            canStudyArchery() {
                return this.#year >1;

            }
        }

        // In this class declaration, #year is a private data property. We can construct a Student object, and it can use #year internally, but if code outside the object tries to access #year the browser throws an error:
        const summers = new Student("Summers", 2);
        summers.introduceSelf(); // Hi! I'm Summers, and I'm in year 2.
        summers.canStudyArchery(); // true
        // summers.#year; // SyntaxError

        // Private data properties must be declared in the class declaration, and their names start with #.


        // 5.Private methods
        // You can have private methods as well as private data properties. Just like private data properties, their names start with #, and they can only be called by the object's own methods:
        class Example {
            somePublicMethod() {
                this.#somePrivateMethod();
            }

            #somePrivateMethod() {
                console.log("You called me?");
            }
            
        }

        const myExample = new Example();
        myExample.somePublicMethod(); // "You called me?"
        myExample.somePrivateMethod(); // SyntaxError
