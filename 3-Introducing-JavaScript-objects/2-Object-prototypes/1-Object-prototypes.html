        // 1.The prototype chain

        // <!-- Note: The property of an object that points to its prototype is not called prototype. Its name is not standard, but in practice all browsers use __proto__. The standard way to access an object's prototype is the Object.getPrototypeOf() method.
        // this concept is very similar to "prototype of class", but if you want to get or set a prototype of a class, such as Person(), you can use:
        const person_prototype = {
          greet() {
            console.log(`hello, my name is ${this.name}!`);
          },
        };

        function Person(name) {
          this.name = name;
        } 

        Object.assign(Person.prototype, personPrototype);

        // but if you want to find the prototype of object.
        let p = new Person("wyl");
        Object.getPrototypeOf(p);

        // When you try to access a property of an object: if the property can't be found in the object itself, the prototype is searched for the property. If the property still can't be found, then the prototype's prototype is searched, and so on until either the property is found, or the end of the chain is reached, in which case undefined is returned.

        // So when we call myObject.toString(), the browser:
        //     1.looks for toString in myObject
        //     2.can't find it there, so looks in the prototype object of myObject for toString

        // The prototype of an object is not always "Object.prototype". Try this:
        const myDate = new Date();
        let object = myDate;

        do {
        object = Object.getPrototypeOf(object);
        console.log(object);
        } while (object);

        // Date.prototype
        // Object { }
        // null


        // 2.Shadowing properties
        // What happens if you define a property in an object, when a property with the same name is defined in the object's prototype? Let's see:
        const myDate1 = new Date(1995, 11, 17);

        console.log(myDate1.getYear()); // 95

        myDate1.getYear = function () {
        console.log("something else!");
        };

        myDate1.getYear(); // 'something else!'
        // This should be predictable, given the description of the prototype chain. When we call getYear() the browser first looks in myDate for a property with that name, and only checks the prototype if myDate does not define it. So when we add getYear() to myDate, then the version in myDate is called.

        // This is called "shadowing" the property.
        // "遮蔽"属性


        // 3.Setting a prototype
        // There are various ways of setting an object's prototype in JavaScript, and here we'll describe two: Object.create() and constructors.

        // 3.1.Using Object.create
        // The Object.create() method creates a new object and allows you to specify an object that will be used as the new object's prototype.

        // Here's an example:
        const personPrototype = {
        greet() {
            console.log("hello!");
        },
        };

        const carl = Object.create(personPrototype);
        carl.greet(); // hello!
        // Here we create an object personPrototype, which has a greet() method. We then use Object.create() to create a new object with personPrototype as its prototype. Now we can call greet() on the new object, and the prototype provides its implementation.


        // 3.2.Using a constructor

        // !!!!!!! important !!!!!!!! 
        // 3.2.1.!!!!!!! "prototype of constructor" !!!!!!!(notice that the prototype of constructor is an object.)
        // In JavaScript, all functions have a property named prototype. When you call a function as a constructor, this property is set as the prototype of the newly constructed object (by convention, in the property named __proto__).
        // 3.2.2.what's the usage of "prototype of constructor"?
        // So if we set the prototype of a constructor, we can ensure that all objects created with that constructor are given that prototype:
        const personPrototype1 = {
          greet() {
              console.log(`hello, my name is ${this.name}!`);
          },
        };

        function Person1(name) {
        this.name = name;
        }

        Object.assign(Person1.prototype, personPrototype1);
        // or
        // Person1.prototype.greet = personPrototype1.greet;

        // Here we create:

        // an object personPrototype, which has a greet() method
        // a Person() constructor function which initializes the name of the person to create.
        // We then put the methods defined in personPrototype onto the Person function's prototype property using Object.assign.

        // After this code, objects created using Person() will get Person.prototype as their prototype, which automatically contains the greet method.
        const reuben = new Person1("Reuben");
        reuben.greet(); // hello, my name is Reuben!
        // This also explains why we said earlier that the prototype of myDate is called Date.prototype: it's the prototype property of the Date constructor.


        // 4.Own properties
        // The objects we create using the Person constructor above have two properties:
            // 1.a name property, which is set in the constructor, so it appears directly on Person objects
            // 2.a greet() method, which is set in the prototype.
        // It's common to see this pattern, in which methods are defined on the prototype, but data properties are defined in the constructor. That's because methods are usually the same for every object we create, while we often want each object to have its own value for its data properties (just as here where every person has a different name).

        // Properties that are defined directly in the object, like name here, are called "own properties", and you can check whether a property is an own property using the static Object.hasOwn() method:
        const irma = new Person1("Irma");

        console.log(Object.hasOwn(irma, "name")); // true
        console.log(Object.hasOwn(irma, "greet")); // false


        // 5.Prototypes and inheritance
        // Prototypes are a powerful and very flexible feature of JavaScript, making it possible to reuse code and combine objects.

        // In particular they support a version of inheritance. Inheritance is a feature of object-oriented programming languages that lets programmers express the idea that some objects in a system are more specialized versions of other objects.

        // For example, if we're modeling a school, we might have professors and students: they are both people, so have some features in common (for example, they both have names), but each might add extra features (for example, professors have a subject that they teach), or might implement the same feature in different ways. In an OOP system we might say that professors and students both inherit from people.

        // You can see how in JavaScript, if Professor and Student objects can have Person prototypes, then they can inherit the common properties, while adding and redefining those properties which need to differ.

        // In the next article we'll discuss inheritance along with the other main features of object-oriented programming languages, and see how JavaScript supports them.
