      // 我去，刚发现这是一个键值对。
      // 所以说可以用person[name], person[age]来查找数据，而且用逗号隔开，说明它们是一个个键值对数据。
      const person = {
        // properties
        name: ["Bob", "Smith"],
        age: 32,
        // methods 
        bio: function () {
          console.log(`${this.name[0]} ${this.name[1]} is ${this.age} years old.`);
        },
        introduceSelf: function () {
          console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name[0]}.`);
        },
        // When the object's members are functions there's a simpler syntax. Instead of bio: function () we can write bio(). Like this:

        // bio() {
        //   console.log(`${this.name[0]} ${this.name[1]} is ${this.age} years old.`);
        // },
        // introduceSelf() {
        //   console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name[0]}.`);
        // },
      };

        // 2.Dot notation
        // Above, you accessed the object's properties and methods using dot notation. The object name (person) acts as the "namespace"
        person.age;
        person.bio();

        // 3.Objects as object properties
        // An object property can itself be an object. For example, try changing the name member from
        const person1 = {
          name: ["Bob", "Smith"],
        };
        // to
        const person2 = {
          name: {
            first: "Bob",
            last: "Smith",
          },
          // …
        };
        person2.name.first;
        person2.name.last;

        // 4.Bracket notation
        // Dot notation is generally preferred over bracket notation because it is more succinct and easier to read. However there are some cases where you have to use square brackets. For example, if an object property name is held in a variable, then you can't use dot notation to access the value, but you can access the value using bracket notation.
        // In the example below, the logProperty() function can use person[propertyName] to retrieve the value of the property named in propertyName.
        const person3 = {
          name: ["Bob", "Smith"],
          age: 32,
        };

        function logProperty(propertyName) {
          console.log(person3[propertyName]);
        }

        logProperty("name");
        // ["Bob", "Smith"]
        logProperty("age");
        // 32


        // 5.Create new members
        // 5.1.Setting members doesn't just stop at updating the values of existing properties and methods; you can also create completely new members. Try these in the JS console:
        person3["eyes"] = "hazel";
        person3.farewell = function () {
          console.log("Bye everybody!");
        };
        // You can now test out your new members:
        person3["eyes"];
        person3.farewell();
        // "Bye everybody!"

        // 5.2.One useful aspect of bracket notation is that it can be used to set not only member values dynamically, but member names too. Let's say we wanted users to be able to store custom value types in their people data, by typing the member name and value into two text inputs. We could get those values like this:
        const myDataName = "height";
        const myDataValue = "1.75m";
        const myDataName1 = "dick";
        person3[myDataName] = myDataValue;
        person3.myDataName1 = "1.85m";
        console.log(person3.height);
        console.log(person3.myDataName1);
        // do you see the difference?


        // 6.What is "this"?
        // You are probably wondering what "this" is. The this keyword refers to the current object the code is being written inside — so in this case this is equivalent to person. So why not just write person instead?
        // Well, when you only have to create a single object literal, it's not so useful. But if you create more than one, this enables you to use the same method definition for every object you create.
        // Let's illustrate what we mean with a simplified pair of person objects:
        const person4 = {
          name: "Chris",
          introduceSelf() {
            console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}.`);
          },
        };

        const person5 = {
          name: "Deepti",
          introduceSelf() {
            console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}.`);
          },
        };


        // 7.Introducing constructors
        // Using object literals is fine when you only need to create one object, but if you have to create more than one, as in the previous section, they're seriously inadequate. We have to write out the same code for every object we create, and if we want to change some properties of the object - like adding a height property - then we have to remember to update every object.

        // We would like a way to define the "shape" of an object — the set of methods and the properties it can have — and then create as many objects as we like, just updating the values for the properties that are different.

        // 7.1.The first version of this is just a function:
        function createPerson(name) {
          const obj = {};
          // 给这个对象增加一个键值对
          obj.name = name;
          // 给这个对象再增加一个键值对
          obj.introduceSelf = function () {
            console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}.`);
          };
          return obj;
        }
        // This function creates and returns a new object each time we call it. The object will have two members:
          // 1.a property name
          // 2.a method introduceSelf().
        // Note that createPerson() takes a parameter name to set the value of the name property, but the value of the introduceSelf() method will be the same for all objects created using this function. This is a very common pattern for creating objects.

        const salva = createPerson("Salva");
        salva.name;
        salva.introduceSelf();
        // "Hi! I'm Salva."

        const frankie = createPerson("Frankie");
        frankie.name;
        frankie.introduceSelf();
        // "Hi! I'm Frankie."


        // 7.2.Constructor
        // This works fine but is a bit long-winded: we have to create an empty object, initialize it, and return it. A better way is to use a constructor. A constructor is just a function called using the new keyword. When you call a constructor, it will:
          // 1.create a new object
          // 2.bind this to the new object, so you can refer to this in your constructor code
          // 3.run the code in the constructor
          // 4.return the new object.
        // Constructors, by convention, start with a capital letter and are named for the type of object they create. So we could rewrite our example like this:
        function Person(name) {
          // 给这个对象增加一个键值对
          this.name = name;
          // 给这个对象再增加一个键值对
          this.introduceSelf = function () {
            console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}.`);
          };
        }
        // this is much simple and clear now.


        // To call Person() as a constructor, we use new:
        const new_salva = new Person("Salva");
        salva.name;
        salva.introduceSelf();
        // "Hi! I'm Salva."

        const new_frankie = new Person("Frankie");
        frankie.name;
        frankie.introduceSelf();
        // "Hi! I'm Frankie."


        // 8.You've been using objects all along
        // When you accessed the document object model using lines like this:
        const myDiv = document.createElement("div");
        const myVideo = document.querySelector("video");
        // You were using methods available on a Document object. For each webpage loaded, an instance of Document is created, called document, which represents the entire page's structure, content, and other features such as its URL. Again, this means that it has several common methods and properties available on it.

        // Note that built in objects and APIs don't always create object instances automatically. As an example, the Notifications API — which allows modern browsers to fire system notifications — requires you to instantiate a new object instance using the constructor for each notification you want to fire. Try entering the following into your JavaScript console:
        const myNotification = new Notification("Hello!");
