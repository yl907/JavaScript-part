An old-fashioned solution to this problem used to be to put your script element right at the bottom of the body (e.g. just before the </body> tag), 
so that it would load after all the HTML has been parsed. The problem with this solution is that loading/parsing of the script is completely blocked 
until the HTML DOM has been loaded. On larger sites with lots of JavaScript, this can cause a major performance issue, slowing down your site.
