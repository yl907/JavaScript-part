"async and defer"
There are actually two modern features we can use to bypass the problem of the blocking script â€” async and defer (which we saw above). 
Let's look at the difference between these two.

Scripts loaded using the async attribute will download the script without blocking the page while the script is being fetched. However, 
once the download is complete, the script will execute, which blocks the page from rendering. 
This means that the rest of the content on the web page is prevented from being processed and displayed to the user until the script finishes executing. 
You get no guarantee that scripts will run in any specific order. 
It is best to use async when the scripts in the page run independently from each other and depend on no other script on the page. 

Scripts loaded with the defer attribute will load in the order they appear on the page. 
They won't run until the page content has all loaded, which is useful if your scripts depend on the DOM being in place (e.g. they modify one or more elements on the page).
